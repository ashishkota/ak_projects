Projects implemented while learning

Hello! Welcome to my learning space! This repo has all the projects that I have implemented while getting deeper into Deep Learning. 
Starting off with simpler projects while hoping to soon have some really cool and interesting work here to showcase

These are the projects I am allowed to share with public (cannot obviously share my work related projects)
I have added the concepts, explanation and comments for most of the code.

Here is list of projects so far:

1. Simple logistic regression - One of the assessment tasks during an interview
2. Multi Layer Perceptron - Building a neural network to extract numerical text from cheques
